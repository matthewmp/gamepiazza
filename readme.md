## Background

I always had some interest in learning game development.  I wanted a chance to create a simple site with basic games.
I especially wanted to work with socket.io besides using it for a chat app.

## Summary

Simple, Retro, Gaming.
Play single / multiplayer games. Keep track of games played, scores, and stats. Message other players while in multiplayer 
games.
